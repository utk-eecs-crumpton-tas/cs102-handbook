# Mac Environment Setup

Setting up homebrew, g++, and VSCode on mac.

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. It allows you to install and manage software packages from the command line.

Get it [here](https://brew.sh/) or run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Keep homebrew and all of its packages up to date with the following command:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade
```

## Install GCC

GCC is a compiler for C and C++.

```bash
brew install gcc
```

GCC will be run with the command `g++-13` instead of `g++`. On a mac, `g++` points to the Apple clang c++ compiler, which is not the same as GCC.

```bash
g++-13 -std=c++11 -o lab0 lab0.cpp
```

## Download VSCode

To install VSCode, you can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

## VSCode Extensions

To add extensions to vscode, hit `cmd+shift+x`.

Install the following extensions:

- `ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack`

## VSCode Explorer

Hit `cmd+shift+p` and type `shell command` and select `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`

This will allow you to open vscode from the command line with the command `code`.

On your system, create a directory for your cs102 files, such as `~/cs102`.

Open vscode from the command line with the command `code ~/cs102`.

You should see all your files in the file explorer on the left with `cmd+shift+e`.

## VSCode Terminal

To open a terminal in vscode, hit ctrl+\`.

If you have a file explorer open to the side, it should start the terminal session in the directory you have open.

## VSCode Code Formatting

To format your code in vscode, hit `shift+option+f`. A prompt will appear asking which formatter you want to use. Select the `ms-vscode.cpptools` we just installed.

## VSCode Settings

To edit your settings in vscode, hit `cmd+shift+p` and search for `settings`. Select `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

I recommend the following settings:

```jsonc
{
  // other settings...
  "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange", // Will save your files automatically when you change focus away from the editor
  "editor.formatOnSave": true // Will automatically format your code when your files are saved
  // other settings...
}
```
