# Lab Machines Environment Setup

Installing neovim and oh-my-zsh on the lab machines

This guide will walk you through installing [https://ohmyz.sh/](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [neovim kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) as well as setting up a language server to enable inline code analysis and autocomplete.

## Setup

To run the install, run the following command

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seeker-3/cs102-resources/main/scripts/install.bash | bash
```

Then restart the shell

```bash
exec zsh
```

## Adding the C++ Language Server to Neovim

Open neovim

```bash
nvim
```

Then run

```vim
:Mason
```

Scroll down to `clangd` and press `i`.

[Here](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim#available-lsp-servers) is a full list of language servers that come with `mason`.

## OMZ Plugins

The script adds the following plugins to OMZ

- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- [autoupdate](https://github.com/tamcore/autoupdate-oh-my-zsh-plugins)

## Customizing

### Oh My Zsh

To customize omz plugins, edit the `~/.zshrc` file with

```bash
nvim ~/.zshrc
```

OMZ comes with several themes you can find [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes)

If you want to add additional plugins, you can `git clone` them into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` and then add them to the `plugins` array in `~/.zshrc`.

### Neovim

To customize neovim, edit the `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` file with

```bash
nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

Watch the following video to learn about customizing neovim and the `init.lua` file

Here is a collection of vim themes you can use

[neovim themes](https://vimcolorschemes.com/)

If you wanted to change your theme to, for example, [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), find the section of the `init.lua` file that looks like this:

```lua
-- Theme inspired by Atom
{
    'navarasu/onedark.nvim',
    priority = 1000,
    config = function() vim.cmd.colorscheme('onedark') end,
},
```

And change it to this:

```lua
{
    'folke/tokyonight.nvim',
    priority = 1000,
    config = function() vim.cmd.colorscheme('tokyonight') end,
},
```
