# Lab Machines Environment Setup

Installing [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [Neovim kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) on the lab machines.

## Examples

After you have run the installation, you will get compiler errors directly inside your editor.

Your command line will have syntax highlighting and autocomplete with the right arrow key.

## Installation

1. Log into a lab machine with [`ssh`](/docs/reference/common-linux-commands#logging-into-the-lab-machines).
2. Run this command

   ```bash
   bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utk-eecs-crumpton-tas/cs102-downloads/main/scripts/install.bash)"
   ```

3. That's it, now you can use Neovim. Just replace `vim` with `nvim` when editing your files.

   ```bash
   nvim file.cpp
   ```

4. If you are on a Mac the color scheme for Neovim will not display correctly in the default terminal app. You can use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) instead.

Here is a [vim command reference](/docs/reference/vim-cheatsheet) to help you get started.

## Customizing (Optional)

### Oh My Zsh

To customize OMZ plugins, edit the `~/.zshrc` file with

```bash
nvim ~/.zshrc
```

OMZ comes with several themes you can find [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes)

If you want to add additional plugins, you can `git clone` them into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` and then add them to the `plugins` array in `~/.zshrc`.

### Neovim

To customize Neovim, edit the `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` file with

```bash
nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

Watch the following video to learn about customizing Neovim and the `init.lua` file

### Neovim Themes

Here is a collection of Vim themes you can use

[Neovim themes](https://vimcolorschemes.com/)

If you wanted to change your theme to, for example, [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), find the section of the `init.lua` file that looks like this:

```lua
-- Theme inspired by Atom
{
    'navarasu/onedark.nvim',
    priority = 1000,
    config = function() vim.cmd.colorscheme('onedark') end,
},
```

And change it to this:

```lua
{
    'folke/tokyonight.nvim',
    priority = 1000,
    config = function() vim.cmd.colorscheme('tokyonight') end,
},
```
