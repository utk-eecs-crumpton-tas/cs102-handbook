# Installing g++

Installing `g++` (Mac & Windows) and `WSL` (Windows)

## Introduction

This guide will cover installing `g++` for your computer. `g++` is the compiler we'll be using to compile our C++ code in this course. It's not necessary to have it on your computer if you only intend to use the lab computers, but it's highly recommended since that is not a pleasant experience.

- _Mac Users_ - You can skip to the [Installing `g++`](/cs102-writeups/docs/general/info?os=macos#installing-xcode-command-line-tools-g) section
- _Windows Users_ - Read on

:::info Windows Users...

This guide will cover installing `WSL`, which is a Linux virtual machine specifically for Windows. It can be a bit annoying to set up, but it's the only way you can get a Unix experience on Windows without SSH, which is important **if you're a CS major**. Otherwise, I would skip to the [Installing `g++` without WSL](/cs102-writeups/docs/general/info?os=windows#installing-g-without-wsl) section instead. `WSL` is not necessary for this course or to install `g++`.

**Bottom line**: If you want to have a Unix environment on your own computer (way more comfortable than using SSH to do that), then install WSL. If you don't care about that, then you can skip it.

### Installing WSL

For Windows users, we'll need to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

1. Navigate to the start menu in the bottom left corner, and find the Powershell application. Right click and _run as administrator_.

2. Once the shell is open, copy and enter the following line

   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```

   ![note about WSL](/info/note1.png)

3. Once WSL is installed, **restart your computer**. I recommend running Ubuntu (the default Linux distribution that's installed) and setting up your new Linux system. It should look like this

   ![ubuntu](/info/s2.png)

   Once started, it should prompt you to create a username/password. Once you've done that, you're set!

### Installing `g++`

Now we'll need to install `g++`, which is the compiler we'll be using to compile our C++ code in this course.

Now that you have Ubuntu opened, enter the following line

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install g++ vim -y
```

It'll prompt you to enter a password because of the `sudo` command. Enter it, and wait for the installation to finish. If there are no errors then you're good to go!

### Final Steps

This isn't necessary but you can test it for fun if you'd like!

Now that you've installed `g++` on your Linux system, let's test it out to make sure everything is working.

In your home directory, enter the following command

```bash
vim test.cpp
```

Now you should be in a very barebones text editor. From here, press `i` and enter the following code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello world!\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Once all that is typed out, press `esc`, and type `wq`, then hit enter.

Now you should be back to the plain terminal screen. From here, enter the following line

```bash
g++ -o test test.cpp
```

Now your program should be compiled into an executable which you can run to see the results of your code by typing

```bash
./test
```

Don't forget the `.` !

If it prints "Hello world!" to your screen, then you've set everything up correctly.

### Final Steps (Optional)

If you installed `WSL` and have completed the steps above, then I recommend you install the **Remote - WSL** extension for VS Code. It'll allow you to open VS Code from your Linux (`WSL`) terminal, which is a lot more convenient than using `vim`.

If you're not familiar with VS Code or extensions, then read the [Pre-setup](/docs/general/pre-setup).

Lastly, I recommend installing Microsoft's official [Terminal emulator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) for Windows. It's a lot more convenient than command prompt or powershell.

### Installing `g++` without WSL

If you don't want to install `WSL`, that's fine, we can still install `g++` without it.

To install, follow the instructions at [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites). It's **imperative** that you follow the instructions exactly, as it's very easy to mess up and then not know why nothing is working. As long as you read the instructions and follow them in order, you should be fine.

After the instruction where it says to do `g++ --version` in the command prompt, you can stop. If you installed `g++` correctly, then running `g++ --version` should print a bunch of version information.

### Installing Xcode Command Line Tools (`g++`)

For Mac users, we'll need to install Xcode Command Line Tools, which will install `g++` for us.

1. press `cmd + space` and type `terminal`, then press enter to open the terminal.
2. Once opened, type and enter the following line

   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```

   This will install the Xcode command line tools. It might take awhile, so sit still while it's installing.

Once installed, you should now be able to compile C++ programs and run them. Restart the terminal application, and enter the following line

```bash
g++ --version
```

If it prints a bunch of version information, then you've successfully installed `g++` and you can stop here!

## Compiling and Running C++ Programs

:::danger

Whenever going to submit your code for an assignment, **ALWAYS** make sure it compiles _and_ behaves (as intended) before doing so -- **ON THE LAB MACHINES**. Compilers work different across computers, so even if it compiled on your computer, it doesn't necessarily compile or behave the same way on the lab machines. The TA's grade using the lab machines, so if your code doesn't compile or work correctly there, you will not get credit for the assignment.

:::

- `g++` - Stands for _GNU C++ Compiler_. This command is used to compile C++ programs. It is the default compiler for C++ programs on Unix/Linux systems. It is also the compiler we will be using in this course.

There are many ways to use the `g++` command, but the most common way is to use the following syntax:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o <binary> <source>.cpp
```

| binary                                                       | source                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| The name of the binary (final executable) you want to create | The name of the source file (your code) you want to compile |

#### example

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o foo lab1.cpp
```

This will compile the `lab1.cpp` file and create a binary called `foo` that you can run with

```bash
./foo
```

:::note

Notice `foo` is just a random name. You can name the executable whatever you want, since the `g++` command will create the binary you specify. Usually though you want to name it something that makes sense, like the name of the program you're writing e.g. `lab1` or `lab2` etc.

:::

We use `./` to tell the computer that we want to run a binary in the current directory. If you want to run a binary in a different directory, you can use the full path to the binary without the `.`

Later in the course, you may be required to compile programs with extra flags that are specific to the lab. These flags will be provided to you in the lab instructions, but it's _paramount_ that you compile with these flags when required. Often times they affect the way your program runs, and if you don't compile with the correct flags, your program may not run correctly, or it may not compile at all, which will net you a 0 on the lab without chance for appeal.
