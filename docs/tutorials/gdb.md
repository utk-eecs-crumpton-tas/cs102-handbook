# GNU Debugger (GDB) Tutorial

Ryan Peruski has put together [a thorough video explaining how to debug runtime errors and segfaults using GDB](https://youtu.be/pS_0VidZHZw?si=UlwUa4muEOv6DzIO).

The video goes over an exception with `stoi`, a segfault, and how to attach GDB to the gradescripts. It also introduces the basic commands you need to know to use GDB.
