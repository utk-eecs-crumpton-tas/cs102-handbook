## Welcome

Welcome to CS102.

This handbook will include supplemental notes as well as references, resources, and tutorials to help you with other concepts you will learn in the class. **You should bookmark this page to reference later.**

### Where to Start

[ssh/scp tutorial video](https://utk-eecs-crumpton-tas.github.io/cs102-handbook/docs/tutorials/ssh-and-scp) `ssh` and `scp` are used to login to the lab machines as well as transfer files between your machine and the lab machines which you will need to do if you want to develop locally.

[About grading](https://utk-eecs-crumpton-tas.github.io/cs102-handbook/docs/grading/about-grading) this section goes into a lot of detail about the formatting portion of your grade and what we will be looking for when we grade your assignments

[Vim cheatsheet](https://utk-eecs-crumpton-tas.github.io/cs102-handbook/docs/reference/vim-cheatsheet) if you want to use `vim` or `nvim` as your primary editor, the basic commands such as cutting, copying, pasting, etc.

[Unix commands reference](https://utk-eecs-crumpton-tas.github.io/cs102-handbook/docs/reference/common-linux-commands) all the commands you will need to get around the terminal such as `ls`, `cd`, `g++`, `scp`, etc.

[Lab machine environment setup](https://utk-eecs-crumpton-tas.github.io/cs102-handbook/docs/environment-setup/lab-machines) after you can log in to the lab machines with `ssh`, this will help you install a better text editor and command line tools. I recommend everyone complete this, it should take only a few minutes.

[Mac](https://utk-eecs-crumpton-tas.github.io/cs102-handbook/docs/environment-setup/mac) and [Windows](https://utk-eecs-crumpton-tas.github.io/cs102-handbook/docs/environment-setup/windows) environment setup. Use these if you want to install `g++` locally on your computer as well as set up vscode with C++. These will take longer to complete than the lab machine setups 30-60 minutes. Remember, if you develop your code locally, you still need to make sure it compiles on the lab machines before submitting or it will be graded as a 0.

[cs102lings repository](https://github.com/utk-eecs-crumpton-tas/cs102lings) the `README` on this repository goes into great detail about how the gradescripts work, how to use them, what the output means, and several features they come with.
